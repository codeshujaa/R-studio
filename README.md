### **[Task 1 - Basic Math with Student Data](https://codeshujaa.github.io/R-studio/Task1/HW2.html)**
I calculated averages and compared different groups of students by hand

### **[Project 1 - Professional Analysis Report](https://codeshujaa.github.io/R-studio/Task2/p1.html)**
Used R to analyze student performance and wrote up the results like a real researcher

### **[Project 2 - Coming Soon!](./Project2/)**
More advanced statistics stuff

### **[Project 3 - Coming Soon!](./Project3/)**
Even more cool analysis

## What's In Here?

This is all my work from my statistics class. I had to do everything by hand first (no calculator functions), then use R studio to make it look professional.

### What I Learned How To Do:
- Calculate means and standard deviations the hard way
- Figure out if differences between groups actually matter
- Use R and Excel to organize my work
- Write up results like scientists do
- Take messy data and turn it into clear answers

### The Data I Used:
I analyzed real information about 30 college students - their test scores, ages, what year they're in school, and other stuff. All the math is real and the conclusions actually mean something.

### My Folder Setup:
```
📁 Task1/ - Where I did basic calculations
📁 Project1/ - My fancy R analysis
📁 Project2/ - (Working on this next)
📁 Project3/ - (Haven't started yet)
```

## Why This Matters

Learning to do statistics by hand first helped me understand what the computer is actually doing.
